	abstract = {Recent advances in teaching, many of which incorporate elements of active learning, seek to provide students with learning experiences indicative of real-world problem solving. Problem-based learning (PBL) is one form of active learning that challenges students to address open-ended problems. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of PBL in achieving the various levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy, compared to the traditional teaching methods of lecture, in-class problems, and homework. In this two-year study of undergraduates at a mid-sized research university, students report their perceived rating of various teaching methods in mastering the educational goals on each level of Bloom’s Taxonomy, from which a cumulative linked mixed model was formed. Students also evaluated their preparedness and increases in skill and confidence for a range of specific tasks associated with completing a PBL project. PBL was the only teaching method to preferentially activate high levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy. Students also reported increases in their skills and confidence (p {\textless} 0.01), with more time spent on high-level tasks, compared to low-level tasks. Qualitative survey responses indicate a plurality of students found PBL engaging and rewarding, with additional benefits to their development of professional skills. Though PBL is not comprehensively better at addressing all levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy compared to other teaching methods, this work has shown it is far superior at addressing the highest Bloom’s Taxonomy levels of Evaluate and Create. Time spent in PBL improves students’ self-efficacy in high-level tasks, preparing them for difficult and ill-defined tasks they may expect to see in future professional and academic environments.},
